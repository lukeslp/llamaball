# Contributing to Llamaball

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Llamaball! This guide will help you get started.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Llamaball is built with **performance optimization and local privacy** as core principles. All contributions should align with these values:

- **Performance First**: Every feature must maintain sub-second response times and optimal resource usage
- **Local Privacy**: All processing happens locally, no data leaves the user's machine
- **Developer-Friendly**: Code should be self-documenting with comprehensive type hints and performance considerations
- **Scalability**: Support for large datasets with efficient memory management and parallel processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lsteuber/llamaball.git
cd llamaball

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e .[dev,test,docs,performance]

# Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
pre-commit install

# Setup development environment with profiling tools
python -m llamaball setup-dev --all
```

### Running Tests & Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=llamaball --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run performance benchmarks
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only --benchmark-json=benchmark.json

# Run specific test file with profiling
pytest tests/test_core.py -v --profile

# Memory profiling
python -m memory_profiler scripts/memory_test.py

# Benchmark embedding generation
python benchmarks/embedding_benchmark.py --models all --datasets test
```

### Code Quality & Performance

```bash
# Format code
black llamaball/ tests/
isort llamaball/ tests/ --profile black

# Type checking with strict mode
mypy llamaball/ --strict --show-error-codes

# Linting
flake8 llamaball/ tests/ --max-line-length 88

# Security analysis
bandit -r llamaball/ -f json -o security-report.json

# Run all quality checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Performance profiling
python -m cProfile -o profile.stats -m llamaball chat --profile
```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Performance

- **Python Version**: Support Python 3.8+, optimized for 3.11+
- **Formatting**: Use `black` with 88-character line length
- **Import Sorting**: Use `isort` with black profile
- **Type Hints**: All functions must have comprehensive type hints
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings with performance notes
- **Performance**: Include complexity analysis and optimization considerations
- **Memory Management**: Efficient resource usage and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with performance fallbacks

### Performance Requirements

1. **Speed Optimization**: Sub-second response times for all operations
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal RAM usage with intelligent caching
3. **Scalability**: Support for large datasets (100k+ documents)
4. **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded operations where beneficial
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Built-in profiling and performance metrics

### Documentation Standards

```python
def example_function(param: str, batch_size: int = 32, parallel: bool = True) -> dict:
    """High-performance document processing with optimization.
    
    Processes documents in parallel batches for optimal throughput.
    Time complexity: O(n/p) where n=documents, p=parallel workers.
    Memory usage: O(batch_size * avg_doc_size).
    
    Args:
        param: Input parameter for processing
        batch_size: Number of documents to process in parallel (default: 32)
        parallel: Enable multi-threaded processing for performance
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing results with performance metrics
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: When param is invalid
        MemoryError: When batch_size exceeds available memory
        
    Performance:
        - Typical throughput: 500-2000 docs/minute
        - Memory usage: ~100MB per 1000 documents
        - Scales linearly with worker count
    """
    pass
```
